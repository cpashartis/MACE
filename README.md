MACE is a sophisticated algorithm designed to optimize and reconstruct surfaces from point clouds by leveraging the principles of configurational energy. This project encapsulates the core of what makes dynamic mesh adaptation possible, providing users with the tools to transform chaotic sets of points into structured, optimized meshes. Ideal for applications in computational geometry, graphics, and scientific visualization, MACE bridges the gap between raw data and actionable geometry.

## Features

- **Point Cloud to Mesh Conversion**: Convert unstructured point clouds into structured mesh representations.
- **Energy-Based Optimization**: Utilize configurational energy principles to optimize the placement and connectivity of mesh points.
- **Adaptive Meshing**: Dynamically adjust mesh density and structure based on local geometric features.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore the evolution of mesh adaptation through an interactive interface.

## Installation

To get started with MACE, clone this repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MACE.git
cd MACE

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running Mace
from mace import MeshAdaptation
import numpy as np
```
# Load your point cloud (example)
points = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Example point cloud data

# Initialize MACE
mace = MeshAdaptation()

# Run the optimization
optimized_mesh = mace.optimize(points)

# Visualize the result (if applicable)
mace.visualize(optimized_mesh)
```

# Advanced Usage
For advanced configurations and usage scenarios, please refer to the documentation or the examples directory in this repository.
